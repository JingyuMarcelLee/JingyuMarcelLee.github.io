# testing table/code on markdown

This post is a test for me to see how codes and tables work on markdown environment.
the all-in-one extension for vscode is used for the ease of editing. markdown preview extension is used as well. kudos to the genius developers who made not-so-genius noob's (my) life easier. 

*let's get started!*

### code

```python
#python
import pandas as pd
x = 'welcome'
print(x)
```
```java
/* java*/
public class practice{
    public static void main(string[] args) {
        string x = 'hello world'
        system.out.println(x)
    } 
}       
```

### math
$  a^2+b^2=c^2 $
### table
<div class="datatable-begin"></div>

| Food    | Description                           | Category | Sample type |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Apples  | A small, somewhat round ...           | Fruit    | Fuji        |
| Bananas | A long and curved, often-yellow ...   | Fruit    | Snow        |
| Kiwis   | A small, hairy-skinned sweet ...      | Fruit    | Golden      |
| Oranges | A spherical, orange-colored sweet ... | Fruit    | Navel       |

<div class="datatable-end"></div>|
