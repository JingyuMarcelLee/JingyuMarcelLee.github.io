# testing table/code on markdown

This post is a test for me to see how codes and tables work on markdown environment.
the all-in-one extension for vscode is used for the ease of editing. markdown preview extension is used as well. kudos to the genius developers who made not-so-genius noob's (my) life easier. 

*let's get started!*

### code

```python
#python
import pandas as pd
x = 'welcome'
print(x)
```
```java
/* java*/
public class practice{
    public static void main(string[] args) {
        string x = 'hello world'
        system.out.println(x)
    } 
}       
```

### math
$$ 
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^2dx
$$
### table
| name   | date     | time |
| ------ | -------- | ---- |
